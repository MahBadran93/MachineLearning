# Ground Truth 
Ground truth represents the desired output of an algorithm on an input. ... It is also the standard you are defining, by which you evaluate an algorithm. The closer your algorithm is to ground truth the better. In the context of object tracking, the ground truth would represent the 'true' state of the object in each frame
